# GlyphsInfo
This is the basic subset of the glyph info that is used inside Glyphs.app.

## Readable Names
the glyph names are derived from the AGL with some adjustments. For glyphs not in that list a name is invented. It’s mostly based on the unicode description but heavily edited to produce short and readable names. To distinguish different scripts, a hyphen+script tag is appended. For common scripts like Arabic and Cyrillic a short version is used (-ar, -cy). Most other scripts just get the full script name to make it easier for people that are not familiar with those scripts.

## Ideograph Entries
The Ideographs and Han glyphs are in a separate file to make it more manageable.

## Contribution
Please fork the repository and send pull requests for missing scripts, changes and misspellings.

## Todo and known issues
The list does not cover the full Unicode. I add script ranges on request as i like to check/edit the results and that is easier if someone involved in that script is around.
